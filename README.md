# Starfinder Ammunition Manager
This extension aids in reloading and tracking the ammunition for Starfinder weapons.
This is forked from bmos' fantastic https://github.com/bmos/FG-Ammunition-Manager where the starfinder code used to reside.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) v4.3.5 (2023-03-07).

This extension works with the SFRPG ruleset.

# Features


* Reloading will allow you to choose what ammunition to load into the gun based on what's in your inventory.

* Attacking will mark-off ammunition automatically. Messages will post to chat if there is no ammunition available or the last bit of ammo was ued up.

* An "INFAMMO" effect negates the counting of used ammo.

* Enabling the "Chat: Show weapon name in results" option will add the weapon name to attack results in chat such as "Attack [16] -> [at Goblin] with Shortsword [HIT]" instead of "Attack [16] -> [at Goblin] [HIT]".

* NOTE: Some starfinder ammo is actually a container of smaller ammo, notably Batteries which hold charges. For now the quanity of batteries should be set to the charge of the battery for ammo counting.
